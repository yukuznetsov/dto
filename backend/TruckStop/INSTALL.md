I don't recommend you on how to install this, but you can try 'qtcreator' for
 build and deploy. I suppose, qtcreator will be yours everything.
Enjoy this. Have fun.

First of all, you have to see and run a script placed at
TruckSrop-client/prepare.sh, that script downloads and generates
'truckstop-services' source files.
After that you'll open that pro-file with qtcreator and has deal with a
head-ache process of build. I'm sure.
