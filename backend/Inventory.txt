Description.
1. E-Table_Examples.
  The files presenting a workflow.
2. E-Tables.
  There are two basic spreadsheets:
  spread_input_empty.xlsx
  universal_out_empty.xlsx
  The first transforms backhaul and truckstop data to a RAST GVRP condition, namely, csv and config files.
  The second transforms solution obtained with RAST as a set of XML files into a csv Report and csv Airtable frontend data. 
3. MySqlScripts, MySqlTables.
  A MySql database was intended to automate data processing. The target was a conversion betweed an input/output data and RAST GVRP task/solution respectively.
  No final version was obtained due to lack of time. Instead, LibreOffice spreadsheets is used.
4. PerlScripts.
  Perl scripts are used for processing RAST solutions.
5. Results.
  The Truckstops.csv and Backhauls.csv files contain input data. All the other files are computational results.
  Report.csv, Summary.csv, AitTable* are report, statistic and AirTable frontend csv-tables respectively.
6. ShellScripts.
  proc_assign.sh script manages the main algorithm workflow. All the other is a simple kit to merge and cleanse data.
7. TruckStop.
  A C++ utility quering data from the Truckstop resource with a configuration and filters predefined. /D. Eremich/

The following is used:
1. Perl script
2. Bash script
3. SQL (MySql)
